        <h3>Lyrics</h3>
        <pre> [Intro]
            Oh, oh, oh
            Oh, oh, oh
            Oh ,oh, oh, oh, oh

            [Verse 1]
            We couldn't turn around 'til we were upside down
            I'll be the bad guy now, but know I ain't too proud
            I couldn't be there even when I tried
            You don't believe it, we do this every time

            [Chorus]
            Seasons change and our love went cold
            Feed the flame 'cause we can't let go
            Run away, but we're running in circles
            Run away, run away
            I dare you to do something
            I'm waiting on you again, so I don't take the blame
            Run away, but we're running in circles
            Run away, run away, run away

            [Verse 2]
            Let go, I got a feeling that it's time to let go
            I said so, I knew that this was doomed from the get-go
            You thought that it was special, special
            But it was just the sex, though, the sex, though
            And I still hear the echoes (The echoes)
            I got a feeling that it's time to let it go, let it go

            [Chorus]
            Seasons change and our love went cold
            Feed the flame 'cause we can't let go
            Run away, but we're running in circles
            Run away, run away
            I dare you to do something
            I'm waiting on you again, so I don't take the blame
            Run away, but we're running in circles
            Run away, run away, run away

            [Bridge]
            Maybe you don't understand what I'm going through
            It's only me, what you got to lose?
            Make up your mind, tell me, what are you gonna do?
            It's only me, let it go

            [Chorus]
            Seasons change and our love went cold
            Feed the flame 'cause we can't let go
            Run away, but we're running in circles
            Run away, run away
            I dare you to do something
            I'm waiting on you again, so I don't take the blame
            Run away, but we're running in circles
            Run away, run away, run away</pre>
